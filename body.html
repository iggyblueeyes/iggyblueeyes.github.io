<p>Hey, what's up? Welcome to my website.</p>
<p>I'm still developing this site, but
  <a href='https://iggyblueeyes.github.io/tutoring/'>tutoring page</a>
  is finished if you'd like to check that out.
</p>
<p>
  I'm a grad school drop out.
  Now I teach math at a middle school in Phoenix, AZ.
  I'm also a bit of an entrepreneur.
  Currently I'm offering tutoring services and you can read about that on this
  <a href='https://iggyblueeyes.github.io/tutoring/'>page</a>.
  I'm interested in mathing web-based apps.
  More to come on this.
