    <h2>Relevant Experience</h2>
    <h4>Private tutoring</h4>
    <p>
      I started privately tutoring students during the Fall of 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had regular weekly sessions with one college student in Calculus I.
      I helped him through most of his homeworks.
      He got an A on all this exams and consequently an A for the class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another college student found me late in the semester.
      He was two weeks out from taking his final.
      He had failed his last two exams.
      We had three sessions and he ended up getting an A on his final.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm open to turoring high school or middle school students as well.
      I've done a few sessions virtually with some students.
      The sessions were fine, but virtual meets don't lend themselves to condusive
      learning environments.
