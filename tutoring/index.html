<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3><span class="emoji">&#129300;</span> How are you qualified to tutor me?</h3>
<p>
  I'm qualitied for three reasons:
</p>
<p>
  <span class="emoji">&#x2714;</span> I have a BS in Mathematics and attended grad school for math for a couple years.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="emoji">&#x2714;</span>
  I teach math at a K-8th school in Phoenix.
  I'm what's called a Math Interventionist.
  Basically I'm at expert in teaching kids that are behind in math.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="emoji">&#x2714;</span> I've tutored lots of students before that did wonderfully on their homeworks and exams with my help.
</p>
<h3><span class="emoji">&#129300;</span> Why don't you offer virtual sessions?</h3>
<p>
  I don't offer virtual sessions as the video call medium does not lend itself towards
  quality interaction between student and teacher. A lot of the teaching methodology
  requires face-to-face to work well.
</p>
<h3><span class="emoji">&#129300;</span> Why don't you have testimonials here?</h3>
<p>
  I think testimonials are kinda flashy and cheap.
  Anyone can just make them up.
  I prefer to get referals from former students or let my first session validate my skills.
</p>
<p>
  If you haven't been referred by a former student of mine, I'll give you 25% off your first session.
  Ask for the discount when you call/text me.
</p>
<h3><span class="emoji">&#129300;</span> If I don't pass my class, will you really give my money back?</h3>
<p>
  Yes.
  Assuming you've been attending a sessions with me at least once a week and
  I have evidence that you study or do homework at home.
  Lastly, I cannot offer this guarantee to students that have started with me less than a month before
  their class ends.
</p>
<h3><span class="emoji">&#129300;</span> Have another question that's not covered here?</h3>
<p>
  Ask me by calling or texting (480) 420 - 8218.
