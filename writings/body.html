<h1>Writings</h1>
<p>
  I'm going to try to limit the topics I write about.
  My thinking tends to be philosophical and anlytical in nature.
  I try	to write concisely.
  I like to think I'm an entrepreneur and a coder.
  I make generative art.
  I work as a math teacher at a K - 8th Title 1 school.
  I attended graduate school for two years in applied math (with focus on epidemiological modeling) then dropped out.

<p>
  I'm more than	the sum	of these experiences though.
  I can't predict exactly what I want to write about.
  Let's find out together.
