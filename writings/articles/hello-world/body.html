<h1>Blog</h1>
<h2>Hello world</h2>
<p>This is my first blog post.</p>
<p>Let's talk about what your can expect.</p>
<p>
  I'm not very consistant. 
  I might have months where I'm really into writing.
  I may have months that I'm not.
  But I promise that everythink I write will be high quality.
</p>
<p>
  I'll try to publish an article every Monday.
</p>
<p>
  That's about it for my first post. Thanks!
</p>
